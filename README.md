## Image Recommender
- This project is a web application that finds similar fashion images or images of the same category that the user wants to find.
- Using deep learning algorithm(CNN : Google Inception retrained model), and Feature point extraction using HOG feature descriptor, and similar color extraction using Color Histogram comparison.
- The model learning process has been conducted with about 10,000 images and 30 classes. In order to improve the efficiency of the search algorithm, CNN, HOG Descriptor, and Color Histogram Extract are sequentially processed, ranked in each step, and sorted.

## Using
- Framework : Python, AWS Django, SQL DB, Tensorflow, 
- Algorithm : CNN, HOG discriptor, Color Histogram dist
